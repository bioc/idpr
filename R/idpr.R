#' idpr: profiling and analyzing Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in R
#'
#' idpr aims to integrate tools for the computational analysis of
#' intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) within R. This package is used to
#' identify known characteristics of IDPs for a sequence of interest with
#' easily reported and dynamic results. Additionally, this package includes
#' tools for IDP-based sequence analysis to be used in conjunction with other R
#' packages.
